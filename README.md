A minimal MERN (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js) application that showcases basic CRUD operations for a to-do list—currently without an update function. This project demonstrates the following skills:

React for the frontend
Node.js + Express for the backend
MongoDB Atlas for cloud-based data storage
Features
Add tasks: Create new to-do items.
View tasks: Display the list of existing tasks.
Delete tasks: Remove tasks from the list.
Note: An update function is not yet implemented in this version.

Prerequisites
Node.js (v14+ recommended)
npm (or yarn)
A MongoDB Atlas account (for your database connection)
Installation & Setup
Clone this repository:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/MERN-Showcase-Todolist.git
cd MERN-Showcase-Todolist
Install dependencies for both backend and frontend:

bash
Copy code
# Backend
cd server
npm install

# Frontend
cd ../client
npm install
Configure MongoDB Atlas:

Create a cluster on MongoDB Atlas.
Copy your MongoDB connection string.
Set up environment variables:

In the server directory, create a file named .env.
Add the following lines to your .env, replacing <your-mongodb-connection-string> with your actual URI:
bash
Copy code
MONGO_URI=<your-mongodb-connection-string>
PORT=5000
Usage
Run the backend:

bash
Copy code
cd server
npm start
The server will start at http://localhost:5000 (unless otherwise configured).

Run the frontend:

bash
Copy code
cd client
npm start
The React app should be available at http://localhost:3000.

Test your to-do list:

Add a task by typing it into the input field and clicking the add button.
View all tasks in the list.
Delete a task by clicking its delete button.
Project Structure
A simple layout might look like this (adjust as needed):

bash
Copy code
MERN-Showcase-Todolist/
├─ client/            # React app
│  ├─ public/
│  └─ src/
│     ├─ App.js
│     └─ index.js
├─ server/            # Express server
│  ├─ routes/
│  ├─ models/
│  ├─ index.js
│  └─ .env
└─ README.md
Next Steps
Update Task: Implement a feature to edit existing tasks.
Authentication: Add user login and registration for personalized to-do lists.
Deployment: Move the app to a hosting platform like Heroku, Vercel, or AWS.
